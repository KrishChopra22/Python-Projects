# Python-Projects
This Repository contains 3 Python Projects :-
    1. Translator
    2. Tron Game (multiplayer)
    3. Air-Hockey Game (multiplayer)
    
Before executing all the programs, you will need to install some packages(modules) like
PyGame, paddlepaddle etc. for game projects and GoogleTrans, speechRecognition, gTTS, PyAudio etc. for Translator.

There are some Notebooks also uploaded but this won't run in Google Colab directly because Google Colab uses Virtual System
to execute.
For testing these projects,
    -> Clone this repository
    -> Download the projects in your system
    -> Install the required packages first
    ->BINGO!!!
      Now, simply press that run button.
